# General Information
## Summary
A game where you play as a ball of fire traversing landscapes made from blocks of different material. As the fire burns the blocks become hotter eventually setting fire to other blocks. As the fireball controlled by the player gets hotter it can rise up in height also being able to jump higher. Each stage the players ultimate goal is lighting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the stage-but the torch is generally placed at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance burning supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the stage.  
Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy learn but engaging play experience.
